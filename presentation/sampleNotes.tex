% To build an accompanying notes file, comment out the first line of `sampleSlides.tex`
% and build this file. Using the pdf viewer Skim, you can then view the notes file on your
% own computer while the audience views your projected slides.
% To do this,
% Open both sampleSlides.pdf and sampleNotes.pdf, change displays to "Extended."
% Move sampleSlides.pdf to the projected screen, and leave sampleNotes.pdf on your screen.
% In sampleSlides.pdf, select `View > Presentation Options > Synchronized Notes Document`
% Then select `View > Presentation` to full-screen your slides.
% The notes slide should then move synchronously with your presentation.
% NOTE: Be sure to include a note at the bottom of every slide, or your presentations will not
% be the same length and this trick won't work so well.
% Be sure to practice before your talk :)
